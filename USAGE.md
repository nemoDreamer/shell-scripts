Usage:
======

Shell scripts
-------------
Each shell script comes w/ a -h | --help option.
These shell scripts are designed to be piped to, so most of them will come with
a corresponding alias.

Tasks
-----
You'll find some NWI3 tasks (mainly for setting up local CPG repos) by using
`cpg.` + TAB completion.

Note:
`cpg.switch` is meant to be run after `cpg.branches` for easy working copy
switching.

Aliases
-------
Run `cat aliases.sh` to see a list of aliases available to you.
